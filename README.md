* [Archive Team](https://www.archiveteam.org/) - A loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving digital heritage. Since 2009 this variant force of nature has caught wind of shutdowns, shutoffs, mergers, and plain old deletions - and done their best to save the history before it's lost forever.
* [Arctic World Archive](https://arcticworldarchive.org/) - A world archive to help preserve the world's digital memory and ensure that the world's most irreplaceable digital memories of art, culture and literature are secured and made available to future generations.

* [Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/) - Non-profit organization based in San Francisco that seeks to become the seed of a very long-term cultural institution. It aims to provide a counterpoint to what it views as today's "faster/cheaper" mindset and to promote "slower/better" thinking.

Information is printed on ceramic tablets, then stored in the salt mine of Hallstatt, Austria. More than a simple archive project, it aims to create the "Time capsule of our era", letting people participate by allowing them to submit texts and images. In contrast to national archives, content for MOM is collected by anyone who takes part. It is a collective, "bottom-up" told history.
* [Memory of the World Programme](https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/partnering/memory-world) - International initiative launched by UNESCO to safeguard the documentary heritage of humanity against collective amnesia, neglect, the ravages of time and climatic conditions, and willful and deliberate destruction.
